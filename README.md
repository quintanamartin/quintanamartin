### Hello world

🚀 About me

🤓 I'm Martín Quintana! I've been working as Front End developer for almost a year. Two years ago, I started learning web development (HTML,CSS, Js). Some months later, Angular called my attention and I gave it a chance. Currently, I'm working with AngularJS and Angular, but I would like to take a break from it and I've started to learn React (with Typescript 🤘).

🎓 I've studied English for more than 10 years. I'm public translator in Argentina 🇦🇷. 

🏀 I love basketball and travelling. 

👪 I'm a proud father of two awesome boys (Camilo and Leon).
